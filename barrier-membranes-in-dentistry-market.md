<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes in Dentistry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Barrier membranes in dentistry are used to facilitate guided tissue regeneration in procedures like dental implants. They are categorized into two types: absorbable membranes and non-absorbable membranes. Absorbable membranes, made from materials like collagen or synthetic polymers, dissolve naturally in the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgical procedure. Non-absorbable membranes, often made from materials like expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), provide longer-term support but require removal after the healing process. Each type has specific applications and benefits in dental treatments.</p></p>
