<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable VNS Devices</li><li>External VNS Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) devices are classified into two main types: implantable SNS devices and external SNS devices. Implantable devices are surgically placed under the skin and deliver continuous electrical pulses to the sacral nerves, providing long-term relief for conditions like urinary incontinence and pelvic pain. External devices, on the other hand, are non-invasive, portable units that stimulate the nerves without surgical intervention, offering a more flexible and temporary treatment option. Both types aim to enhance patient quality of life.</p></p>
