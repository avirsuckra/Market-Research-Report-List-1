<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocoal (Synthetic Coal) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biocoal, also known as synthetic coal, is produced from biomass through processes like torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in a low-oxygen environment, enhancing its energy density and making it more suitable for co-firing with coal. In contrast, steam explosion utilizes high-pressure steam to break down biomass, improving its digestibility and energy output. Both markets focus on producing renewable energy sources that reduce carbon emissions, enhancing sustainability in energy production.</p></p>
