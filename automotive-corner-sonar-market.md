<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Corner Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar</li><li>Active Sonar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive corner sonar systems are categorized into two main types: passive and active sonar. Passive sonar systems detect sound waves and reflect them to identify nearby objects without emitting signals, relying on existing noise signals. In contrast, active sonar systems emit sound waves and analyze the echoes that return after hitting an object, providing real-time data on distances and shapes. Both types enhance vehicle safety by assisting with parking, obstacle detection, and collision avoidance in tight spaces.</p></p>
